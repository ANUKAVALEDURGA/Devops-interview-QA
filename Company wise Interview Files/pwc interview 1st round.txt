9. how do you encrypt sensitive data in ansible  
In Ansible, sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and other credentials should be encrypted to protect them from unauthorized access. Ansible provides a feature called "Vault" that allows you to encrypt sensitive data.

Here are the steps to encrypt sensitive data in Ansible using Vault:

Create a vault file: Create a new file with a .vault extension to store your encrypted data. You can create this file using the ansible-vault create command, which will prompt you to enter and confirm a password. For example:

lua
Copy code
ansible-vault create mysecrets.vault
Edit the vault file: Open the vault file in your favorite text editor and add your sensitive data in plain text. For example:

makefile
Copy code
my_password: supersecret
api_key: 12345
Encrypt the vault file: Encrypt the vault file using the ansible-vault encrypt command. For example:

Copy code
ansible-vault encrypt mysecrets.vault
This will encrypt the contents of the file using the password you entered in step 1.

Use the vault file in your playbook: To use the encrypted data in your playbook, you need to specify the path to the vault file and the password to decrypt it. You can do this by adding the --ask-vault-pass option to the ansible-playbook command, which will prompt you to enter the vault password. For example:

python
Copy code
ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --ask-vault-pass
You can also specify the vault password in a file or environment variable using the --vault-password-file or --vault-password-env options, respectively.

Use the encrypted variables in your playbook: To use the encrypted variables in your playbook, you need to wrap them with the vault filter. For example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Set the password
  debug:
    msg: "The password is {{ my_password | vault }}"
This will decrypt the value of my_password and display it in the output.

By following these steps, you can encrypt sensitive data in Ansible using Vault to protect it from unauthorized access. It's important to keep the vault password secure and to limit access to the encrypted files to only those who need it.
10. why ansible is much popular with compare to other tools
ANS:  ansible is agentless, with other tools we need to install agent in all machine 
11. how ansible work . how install or tell me ansible configuration
12. how to do the passwordless connection configartion 
13. master slave configuration 
14. did you configure window slave 
15. have you heard about JNLP agent java network luanch protocal
16. i have a 10 slaves and my perticular pipeline job i want to run in 'a' slave machine how you will configure 
17. diffrence between git pull and git fetch
18. do you have used python 
18. any other progarmming u know
19. if i want to get the uniq shell type can you give me how you approch this 
20. can i get reverse of the string can you tell me the steps 
21. in docker file we have 10 cmd  command which cmd command will run first 
22. diffrent cmd and entrypoint
23. what is a multi stage build in docker
24. docker container it has a memory leack so it used entire host memory what will happen to my host (VM) (try u utilize 100%)
ANS: 1. in case of memory ur VM will get crashhed bcz vm needs to other system  process will wok 
          2. in case of cpu utilization it just slow down 
25. what is daemonset in k8s
26. what is diffrence between udp and tcp traffic 
27. aws services u have used
28. what is differnce bteween layer 4 and layer 7 in LB 
29. i have a 3 tier application i need to deploy on aws can you give me list of services ur going to use considering high availibility and scalability and end to end security
30. how do you diffrentiate between public subnet and private subnet
31. assume have 100 vpc and and how they communicate how u make the connectivity
Ans: with transit gate we can make it 
32. in vpc peering can we use VPN in between them
ans: no VPN connection is required. for VPC peering
