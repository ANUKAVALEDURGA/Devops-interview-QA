3. How to stop autoscaling in aws ?
To stop autoscaling in AWS, you can perform the following steps:
Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Auto Scaling service.
Select the autoscaling group that you want to stop.
Click on the "Edit" button in the "Auto Scaling Group Details" section.
In the "Desired Capacity" field, set the value to 0.
Click on the "Update" button to save the changes.
Setting the "Desired Capacity" to 0 will cause the autoscaling group to stop scaling and terminate all of its instances. Any new requests or traffic 
will not trigger any new instance launches. However, keep in mind that the instances that were launched by the autoscaling group will still be running 
and will need to be terminated manually. You can do this by navigating to the EC2 Instances page and terminating the instances that were launched by the 
autoscaling group.

It's important to note that stopping autoscaling can have a significant impact on the availability and performance of your application. You should consider 
the implications before stopping autoscaling and ensure that you have a plan in place to manage your application's resources manually if necessary.
