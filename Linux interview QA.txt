1 * how do you disable swap memory through cmd line and it should not get added to the system ?

      swapoff -a
	  
2 * how to make sure that file system does'nt get mounted upon the reboot ?

		The simplest way to force fsck filesystem check on a root partition 
		eg. /dev/sda1 is to create an empty file called forcefsck in the partition's root directory. 
		This empty file will temporarily override any other settings and force fsck to check the filesystem on the next system reboot
		
3 * have you created a file system and how you ensure those file systems are available after reboot (etc filesystems)? (need to check in youtube)



 4 * after mounting EBS to instance, weather that will be still available after reboot ?

      Command 4: Run the command, “top” . See the first line of top command's output.

7 * CMD check usage of memory / ram of the system ?

21* how to login ec2 if pem key lost

    Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.

1. First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.

2. Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.

3. Goto EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.

4. Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

5. Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

6. Execute below commands:


Talk to our Experts!
# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
# cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
# umount /mnt
7. Detach the secondary volume from helper instance. 

8. Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.

Use helper instance pem file to log into recovery instance.
