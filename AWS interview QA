  17 * IAM ? I have 10 instances, how do you give access to user for only 5 resources ?
		a. Create custome policy, using AWS policy generator  --> https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/
		b. Add the arn for your instances for which you need to give access to {arn:aws:ec2:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:instance/<instance-id>}
			i. Example arn:: arn:aws:ec2:ap-south-1:892145454499:instance/i-01e8028f2af843ddb 
		c. Copy the JSON from the policy generator and then copy to the create policy, new policy json 
		d. Attach the policy then to the user 
		e. Now login via the user and check the actions that can be performed for the accessible instances 
	
  18 * Cross region Route53 ?
		○ Answer is Route53 Resolver, inbound endpoints, outbound endpoint 
		○ Explanation is here --> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/using-route-53-private-hosted-zones-for-cross-account-multi-region-architectures/
	
  19 * Health checks in Route53
		○ Monitor the health and performance of the endpoints
		○ Create health check to monitor inbound/outbound endpoints

 43 * diff b/w cname and alias?
		○ CNAME record points a DNS name to another DNS name 
		○ Alias is similar to CNAME record but when querying it will behave like A record and give the target ip address 
  44 * what record used for dns to ip?
		A record 

  51 * Security group  ,nacl 
		○ Security group is configure inbound traffic (outbound traffic is default configured, unless specifically restriced)   {Stateful}
		○ NACL - Network access control list is to control the inbound and outbound traffic on the network (or) VPC where is it configured  (Stateless)
  58 * aws VPC components
		Subnet, routing table, IGW, NAT Gateway, NACL, Security Group 
  59 * what are the DB you are going to use
		○ Depending on the requirment, structured (or) non-structured DB requirement
		○ If Structured - SQl, MySQL, Aurora, MariaDB
		○ Non-Structured - Dynamo DB, MongoDB
   65 * how will you restrict inbound traffic when outbound traffic in open
		Using Security Groups 
  66 * what is vpc and vpc peering
		VPC - virtual private cloud, VPC peering is method to connect between 2 VPC's 
  67 * How will an instance present in Oregon can access a S3 bucket present in Sydney without any manual intervention?
	 (only the ec2 shd b able to access the S3 without any user involved in it,)
	
		Making the S3 bucket as Public  (also check if Assume role can be used or not ) 
	
  69 * One ALB with 2 instances A and B and ALB is mapped with 2 website site1 and site2, Can we configure requests which comes to site1 mapped to instance A n site2 to instance B,  Can we achieve this behaviour using ALB?
		ALB configuring Listeners and routing, where port/protocol configured with either A (or) B instance and given the target group 
  72 * I have one S3 bucket in which im going to upload 3 files, one with 2TB, 4.9TB and 5.1TB,  So how many files will get uploaded into S3 bucket?
		2 files will be uploaded, 2 TB and 4.9 TB, 5.1TB file will be rejected as 5TB is the maximum size limit of a object 
  102* how can we connect s3 through vpc privately
				Create a new access point on S3 and specify the VPC id through which we need to connect 
  103* how can we execute round robin waited routing of route53
				Traffic policy --> Create traffic policy --> Weighted rule (either 1 or 3 ) --> specify endpoint 
  104* how can you search for particular error in K8s cloudwatch
  105* Apln load balancer :
				Create application load balancer 
				Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic
			
  106* User data ,meta data
				User data is information that we can provide to an instance, which is accessed during the starting of an instance, so if any script needs to be run when instance starts up, we can provide the information in instance user data
				Meta data --> data about instance, which will help in configuring the instance 
  107* Listener target 
				 Listener target is the target group that the load balancer needs to send the traffic to 
				 We specify the type of protocol, port number and the target value (complete path) 
  108* Cross zone load balancing 
				 Elastic Load balancing -->https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html 
				 Create a Network load balancer (or) Gateway load balancer and then enable the cross zone load balancing option after the creation of the load balancers 
  109* Application load balancer , classic network; disable ,pricing
				Types of load balancer need to explain, pricing - check aws pricing 
  120* SQL vs No SQL
			Structured DB vs Unstructured DB 
  121* In aws, i have an instance which is critical machine that cant go down and its reaching 100% cpu utilisation.
		            what are the steps that u r going to take to save this machine from going down? 
			Autoscaling --> add the running instance to an existing AutoScaling group (or) create an autoscaling group based on the running instance 
			Horizontal (or) Vertical autoscaling can be chosen 
  123* I have a ec2 instance, I want to change the private ip of that instance, can I do that?
			No, private ip address is permanent for the instance lifetime and it cannot be changed 
  124* Can I change the private ip of running ec2 instance?
			No, private ip address is permanent for the instance lifetime and it cannot be changed 
  125* I have a S3 bucket, which my client want to track the access for internal audit.
			CloudTrail is the auditing tool
